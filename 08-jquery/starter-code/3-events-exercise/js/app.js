/*

Add event listeners to the 3 buttons at the top of the page.
Clicking each button should hide the block below it with the corresponding color.

*/

// STEP 1
// After the variable declarations below, write statements setting the value of each variable to reference one of the three buttons at the top of the page.
// (HINT: The buttons have the id values r, b, and y.)

let redBtn;
let blueBtn;
let yellowBtn;



// STEP 2
// After the variable declarations below, write statements setting the value of each variable to reference one of the three blocks in the middle of the page.
// (HINT: The blocks have the class values red, blue, and yellow.)

let redBlock;
let blueBlock;
let yellowBlock;



// STEP 3
// Write a statement to add an event listener to the redBtn element. In response to the click event, it should add the class name 'hidden' to the redBlock element.



// STEP 4
// Write a statement to add an event listener to the blueBtn element. In response to the click event, it should add the class name 'hidden' to the blueBlock element.



// STEP 5
// Write a statement to add an event listener to the yellowBtn element. In response to the click event, it should add the class name 'hidden' to the yellowBlock element.



// STEP 6
// Save your changes, open index.html in your browser, and test each of the buttons.


// BONUS
// Add an event listener for the "Show all blocks" button that removes the hidden class from all the colored block elements.
// (HINT: Use a loop.)
